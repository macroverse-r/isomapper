\title{Convert Country Name to ISO3 Code}
\usage{
im_ctry2iso(country_name, verbose = TRUE, min_letter = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{country_name}{Character vector containing the country names to convert.
The function accepts various formats and spellings, including:
\itemize{
\item Official names (e.g., "United States of America")
\item Common names (e.g., "United States", "USA")
\item Historical names (e.g., "Burma" for Myanmar)
\item Names with special characters (e.g., "CÃ´te d'Ivoire")
\item Names with abbreviations (e.g., "Rep." for Republic)
}}

\item{verbose}{Logical, whether to print information about matching method used
when exact match fails (default: TRUE)}

\item{min_letter}{Integer, minimum number of letters required for prefix and
partial matching attempts (default: 5). Only used if exact match fails.}
}
\value{
Character vector of the same length as country_name containing ISO3 codes.
Returns NA for entries where no match is found, with a warning message if verbose=TRUE.
}
\description{
Converts country names to their corresponding ISO3 codes. The function
uses a hierarchical matching strategy: first trying exact match, then prefix and
partial matches if the input is long enough, while avoiding matches on common words.
}
\details{
The function performs matching in the following order:
\enumerate{
\item Normalizes input name (converts to lowercase, removes special characters,
standardizes spacing)
\item Attempts exact match with normalized names
\item If exact match fails and input length >= min_letter:
\itemize{
\item Tries prefix match (input matches start of country name)
\item Tries partial match (input is contained within country name)
\item Skips matching on common words like "United", "Republic", etc.
\item If verbose=TRUE, informs user about successful prefix/partial match
}
}
}
\examples{
# Single country
im_ctry2iso("France")  # Returns "FRA"

# Multiple countries
im_ctry2iso(c("India", "China", "Italy"))  # Returns c("IND", "CHN", "ITA")

# Mixed cases with some partial matches, short abbreviations, and errors
im_ctry2iso(c("franc", "Deutsche", "Kingdom", "us", "UAE", "Jamai"))
